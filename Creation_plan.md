# Deep Thinking Chain for Investment Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a lightweight multi-agent system to conduct iterative deep research cycles, specifically tailored for evaluating investment opportunities (e.g., analyzing a stock like NVDA). The system orchestrates tool-calls, analysis, planning, and summarization iteratively to produce comprehensive investment insights.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lightweight multi-agent system helps investors systematically research stock opportunities. Each agent performs a clearly defined taskâ€”fetching data, analyzing results, planning subsequent actions, and summarizing findingsâ€”in an iterative "Deep Thinking Chain" loop.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

```
[Coordinator] â†’ [Tool Agent] â†’ [Analysis Agent] â†’ [Planning Agent] (repeat)
                            â”‚
                            â””â”€â”€â†’ [Summarization Agent]
```

**Cycle steps:**
1. **Tool Call:** Fetches external financial and market data.
2. **Analysis:** Extracts key insights, identifies strengths, risks, and opportunities.
3. **Planning:** Determines if further iterations are needed or moves to summarization.
4. **Summarization:** Aggregates and summarizes key insights for final decision-making.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Example

```
[Coordinator] â†’ Initiates query for stock (e.g., NVDA)
    â”œâ”€â”€ ToolAgent fetches initial financial data
    â”œâ”€â”€ Analysis Agent extracts insights (moat, CapEx, risks)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Planning Agent decides next steps (further analysis needed?)
    â””â”€â”€ Loop repeats as needed â†’ Final Summarization Agent synthesizes insights
```
