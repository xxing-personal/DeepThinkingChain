Absolutely! There are multiple ways you can calculate a stock price target, depending on the method you choose. Here, I'll outline several common methods and demonstrate how to write simple Python functions for each:

### Method 1: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Method

This method calculates the target price based on projected earnings and an expected P/E ratio.

**Formula**:

\[
\text{Target Price} = \text{Expected EPS} \times \text{Expected P/E}
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_pe_target_price(expected_eps, expected_pe_ratio):
    return expected_eps * expected_pe_ratio

# Example usage:
price_target = calculate_pe_target_price(5.0, 15.0)  # EPS: 5.0, Expected P/E: 15
print(f"Price Target (P/E Method): ${price_target:.2f}")
```

### Method 2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method

DCF calculates the intrinsic value based on future cash flows discounted to present value.

**Formula**:

\[
\text{Target Price} = \frac{\text{Projected Free Cash Flow per Share}}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Growth Rate})}
\]

*(Simplified perpetuity growth model)*

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_dcf_target_price(fcf_per_share, discount_rate, growth_rate):
    if discount_rate <= growth_rate:
        raise ValueError("Discount rate must be greater than growth rate.")
    return fcf_per_share / (discount_rate - growth_rate)

# Example usage:
price_target = calculate_dcf_target_price(4.0, 0.10, 0.04)  # $4 FCF, 10% discount, 4% growth
print(f"Price Target (DCF Method): ${price_target:.2f}")
```

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

DDM uses expected dividends to estimate the stock price.

**Formula**:

\[
\text{Target Price} = \frac{\text{Dividend per Share}}{(\text{Required Rate of Return} - \text{Dividend Growth Rate})}
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_ddm_target_price(dividend_per_share, required_return, dividend_growth_rate):
    if required_return <= dividend_growth_rate:
        raise ValueError("Required return must be greater than dividend growth rate.")
    return dividend_per_share / (required_return - dividend_growth_rate)

# Example usage:
price_target = calculate_ddm_target_price(2.5, 0.08, 0.03)  # $2.5 dividend, 8% required return, 3% growth
print(f"Price Target (DDM Method): ${price_target:.2f}")
```

### Method 4: Price-to-Sales (P/S) Method

This method calculates price based on sales per share and a historical or sector-based P/S multiple.

**Formula**:

\[
\text{Target Price} = \text{Sales per Share} \times \text{Expected P/S ratio}
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_ps_target_price(sales_per_share, expected_ps_ratio):
    return sales_per_share * expected_ps_ratio

# Example usage:
price_target = calculate_ps_target_price(10.0, 2.5)  # $10 sales per share, P/S: 2.5
print(f"Price Target (P/S Method): ${price_target:.2f}")
```

---

### Method 5: Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Method

Calculating based on EBITDA per share and an expected EV/EBITDA multiple.

**Formula** (simplified):

\[
\text{Target Price} = (\text{EBITDA per Share} \times \text{EV/EBITDA}) - \text{Net Debt per Share}
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_ev_ebitda_target_price(ebitda_per_share, ev_ebitda_ratio, net_debt_per_share):
    return (ebitda_per_share * ev_ebitda_ratio) - net_debt_per_share

# Example usage:
price_target = calculate_ev_ebitda_target_price(7.0, 8.0, 5.0)  # EBITDA: $7, EV/EBITDA: 8, Net Debt: $5
print(f"Price Target (EV/EBITDA Method): ${price_target:.2f}")
```

### Putting It All Together

You can organize these into a unified interface like so:

```python
def calculate_price_target(method, **kwargs):
    methods = {
        "PE": calculate_pe_target_price,
        "DCF": calculate_dcf_target_price,
        "DDM": calculate_ddm_target_price,
        "PS": calculate_ps_target_price,
        "EV_EBITDA": calculate_ev_ebitda_target_price
    }
    
    if method not in methods:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported method: {method}")
    
    return methods[method](**kwargs)

# Example usage:
target_pe = calculate_price_target("PE", expected_eps=6.5, expected_pe_ratio=14)
print(f"Unified Price Target (P/E): ${target_pe:.2f}")

target_dcf = calculate_price_target("DCF", fcf_per_share=3.5, discount_rate=0.12, growth_rate=0.05)
print(f"Unified Price Target (DCF): ${target_dcf:.2f}")
```

### Choosing a Method
- **P/E and P/S** methods are simpler and useful when earnings or sales growth is stable.
- **DCF and DDM** methods provide intrinsic valuations, beneficial for longer-term outlooks.
- **EV/EBITDA** is often used for capital-intensive or highly leveraged companies.

Choose according to your needs, and adapt the functions accordingly. Would you like to refine any particular method or explore additional complexities?
