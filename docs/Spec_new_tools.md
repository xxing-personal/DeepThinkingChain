# ðŸ“„ **Specification Document: Python Code Execution Tool**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
îˆƒTo develop a secure and efficient Python code execution tool that enables agents within the multi-agent system to generate and execute Python code snippets dynamically. This functionality allows agents to perform complex computations, automate tasks, and interact with various tools programmaticall.îˆ„îˆ†

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview*

îˆƒThe Python Code Execution Tool will allow agents o:îˆ„îˆ†

- **Generate Python Code:* îˆƒAgents can produce Python code snippets based on their reasoning and the tasks at had.îˆ„îˆ†
- **Execute Code Securely:* îˆƒThe system will execute the generated code in a controlled and secure environment to prevent malicious activitis.îˆ„îˆ†
- **Retrieve Results:* îˆƒAgents will receive the output of the executed code to inform subsequent actions or decisios.îˆ„îˆ†

---

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow**

1. **Agent Reasoning** îˆƒAn agent determines the need to perform a computation or task that requires code executon.îˆ„îˆ†
2. **Code Generation** îˆƒThe agent generates a Python code snippet tailored to the tsk.îˆ„îˆ†
3. **Code Submission** îˆƒThe agent submits the code to the Python Code Execution Tol.îˆ„îˆ†
4. **Secure Execution** îˆƒThe tool executes the code within a sandboxed environment to ensure securty.îˆ„îˆ†
5. **Result Retrieval** îˆƒThe tool returns the execution result to the agnt.îˆ„îˆ†
6. **Agent Utilization** îˆƒThe agent uses the result to proceed with its workfow.îˆ„îˆ†

## ðŸ“š **Key Components and Function Docstrings**

### ðŸŸ¢ `tools/code_execution_tool.py`

```python
class CodeExecutionTool:
    """
    Tool that allows agents to execute Python code snippets securely.
    """

    def __init__(self, executor):
        """
        Initialize the CodeExecutionTool with a secure executor.

        Parameters:
        - executor: An instance of SecureExecutor responsible for executing code safely.
        """
        self.executor = executor

    def execute_code(self, code_snippet: str) -> dict:
        """
        Execute the provided Python code snippet securely.

        Parameters:
        - code_snippet (str): The Python code to execute.

        Returns:
        - dict: A dictionary containing the execution result or error information.
        """
        return self.executor.run(code_snippet)
```

### ðŸŸ¢ `sandbox/secure_executor.py`

```python
class SecureExecutor:
    """
    Executes Python code snippets in a secure, sandboxed environment.
    """

    def __init__(self, allowed_imports=None, execution_timeout=5):
        """
        Initialize the SecureExecutor with security parameters.

        Parameters:
        - allowed_imports (list): A list of module names that are permitted to be imported.
        - execution_timeout (int): Maximum time in seconds allowed for code execution.
        """
        self.allowed_imports = allowed_imports or []
        self.execution_timeout = execution_timeout

    def run(self, code_snippet: str) -> dict:
        """
        Execute the provided Python code snippet in a sandboxed environment.

        Parameters:
        - code_snippet (str): The Python code to execute.

        Returns:
        - dict: A dictionary containing the execution result or error information.
        """
        # Implementation of secure code execution
        pass
```

## ðŸ”’ **Security Consideraions**

îˆƒExecuting arbitrary code poses significant security risks. To mitigate thee risks:îˆ„îˆ†

- **Sandboxed Enviroment:** îˆƒExecute code within a restricted environment that limits access to system rsources.îˆ„îˆ†
- **Restricted Imorts:** îˆƒAllow only a predefined list of safe modules to be mported.îˆ„îˆ†
- **Execution Timouts:** îˆƒImplement timeouts to prevent infinite loops or long-running pocesses.îˆ„îˆ†
- **Resource Lmits:** îˆƒRestrict CPU and memory usage to prevent resource exausion.îˆ„îˆ†

îˆƒFor enhanced security, consider using established sandboxing solutions like [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) or Docker containers to isolate code eecution.îˆ„îˆ†

## ðŸš€ **Integration Steps**

1. **Develop SecureExcutor:** îˆƒImplement the `SecureExecutor` class with robust securitymeasures.îˆ„îˆ†
2. **Create CodeExecutinTool:** îˆƒDevelop the `CodeExecutionTool` that utilizes the `Securexecutor`.îˆ„îˆ†
3. **Integrate with gents:** îˆƒModify agent classes to utilize the `CodeExecutionTool` for executing generted code.îˆ„îˆ†
4. **Tsting:** îˆƒThoroughly test the code execution process to ensure functionality andsecurityîˆ„îˆ†

îˆƒBy following this specification, you can implement a Python code execution tool that empowers your agents to perform dynamic computations securely, enhancing the capabilities of your multi-aget system.îˆ„îˆ†
