# Creation History

## Intialization

### DeepThinkingChain Class Overview

* Initialization (__init__ method):
Takes a stock symbol and optional max_iterations parameter
Initializes all four agents (Tool, Analysis, Planning, Summarization)
Creates necessary directories (memory, results)
Sets up or loads memory for the analysis process
* Run Method:
Implements the iterative workflow described in the documentation
Follows the sequence: Tool Agent → Analysis Agent → Planning Agent
Continues iterations until either:
The Planning Agent determines analysis is complete
Maximum iterations are reached
Calls the Summarization Agent when analysis is complete
Saves the final summary to a markdown file in the results directory
* Helper Methods:
_save_memory(): Persists the analysis state to disk
* Main Execution Block:
Allows running the script directly with a stock symbol as a command-line argument
Prompts for a symbol if not provided via command line

### ToolAgent Class Overview

* Core Functionality:
Implements a client for the Financial Modeling Prep API
Handles API authentication via environment variables
Provides comprehensive error handling for API requests
* Main Methods (as specified in the requirements):
fetch_company_profile(symbol): Retrieves basic company information including name, description, sector, industry, market cap, and current price
fetch_financial_ratios(symbol): Gets detailed financial ratios including profitability, liquidity, solvency, and valuation metrics
* Additional Methods:
fetch_data(symbol, focus): A flexible method that fetches different types of financial data based on the current analysis focus
Various helper methods to fetch specific types of financial data:
Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements
Peer/competitor information
Growth estimates and analyst recommendations
Key metrics and DCF valuation
SEC filings
* Helper Methods:
_make_request(endpoint, params): Handles the actual API communication

#### How to Use the AnalysisAgent

The AnalysisAgent can be used in two main ways:

1. **Direct Analysis**:
   ```python
   from agents.analysis_agent import AnalysisAgent
   
   # Initialize the agent
   agent = AnalysisAgent()
   
   # Analyze financial data
   result = agent.analyze(data, focus="financial_performance", symbol="NVDA")
   
   # Access the analysis results
   insights = result["insights"]
   key_points = result["key_points"]
   sentiment = result["sentiment"]
   ```

2. **Summarization of Multiple Analyses**:
   ```python
   # After collecting multiple analyses
   summary = agent.summarize_analyses(analyses_list, symbol="NVDA")
   ```

The implementation follows the requirements specified in the Creation_plan.md file and integrates well with the existing orchestrator.py and tool_agent.py files.

### PlanningAgent Implementation

   - **Focus Area Management**: Tracks which focus areas have been covered and determines the next area to explore
   - **Completion Criteria**: Uses configurable criteria to determine when research is complete
   - **Reasoning**: Provides clear explanations for decisions
   - **Completion Tracking**: Calculates and reports research completion percentage

3. **Advanced Capabilities**:
   - **LLM-Based Focus Determination**: Uses OpenAI API to determine the next focus area when all basic areas are covered
   - **Uncertainty Detection**: Identifies when further research is needed based on analysis content
   - **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusts research focus based on previous findings

#### Test Results

The test results show that the PlanningAgent is working correctly:

1. **Scenario 1**: In the first iteration with only financial analysis, it correctly decides to continue and focus on risk assessment (a required area).
2. **Scenario 2**: In the second iteration with financial and competitive analyses, it still decides to continue and focus on risk assessment.
3. **Scenario 3**: In the third iteration with all required analyses covered, it decides to continue but shifts focus to growth prospects.
4. **Scenario 4**: With low confidence analysis, it correctly decides to continue research to improve confidence.
