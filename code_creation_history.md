# Creation History

## Intialization

### DeepThinkingChain Class Overview

* Initialization (__init__ method):
Takes a stock symbol and optional max_iterations parameter
Initializes all four agents (Tool, Analysis, Planning, Summarization)
Creates necessary directories (memory, results)
Sets up or loads memory for the analysis process
* Run Method:
Implements the iterative workflow described in the documentation
Follows the sequence: Tool Agent → Analysis Agent → Planning Agent
Continues iterations until either:
The Planning Agent determines analysis is complete
Maximum iterations are reached
Calls the Summarization Agent when analysis is complete
Saves the final summary to a markdown file in the results directory
* Helper Methods:
_save_memory(): Persists the analysis state to disk
* Main Execution Block:
Allows running the script directly with a stock symbol as a command-line argument
Prompts for a symbol if not provided via command line

### ToolAgent Class Overview

* Core Functionality:
Implements a client for the Financial Modeling Prep API
Handles API authentication via environment variables
Provides comprehensive error handling for API requests
* Main Methods (as specified in the requirements):
fetch_company_profile(symbol): Retrieves basic company information including name, description, sector, industry, market cap, and current price
fetch_financial_ratios(symbol): Gets detailed financial ratios including profitability, liquidity, solvency, and valuation metrics
* Additional Methods:
fetch_data(symbol, focus): A flexible method that fetches different types of financial data based on the current analysis focus
Various helper methods to fetch specific types of financial data:
Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements
Peer/competitor information
Growth estimates and analyst recommendations
Key metrics and DCF valuation
SEC filings
* Helper Methods:
_make_request(endpoint, params): Handles the actual API communication
* Key Features
  * Well-documented: All methods include comprehensive docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values
  * Error handling: All API calls are wrapped in try/except blocks to gracefully handle failures
  * Flexible: The implementation supports both basic data fetching and more advanced, focused analysis
